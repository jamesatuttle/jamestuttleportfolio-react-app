        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I came to Newcastle for University and then stayed in the city for work. Iâ€™ve had a couple of jobs within tech, starting as an <span className='bigger'>Assistant Software Developer</span> for HMRC, a <span className='bigger'>Website Developer</span> then a <span className='bigger'>Junior Frontend Developer</span> and I currently work as a <span className='bigger'>Platform Support Engineer</span> for Partnerize.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love keeping fit with swimming, the gym and rock climbing. I also love Console and PC gaming, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and travelling to experience the world and finding awesome street art.</p>
